decerno!\\nat decerno, we are united around a great interest in technology. we like technical \\nchallenges and solving difficult problems together.\\nthe company culture is caring without inhibiting one\\'s own initiatives and ideas.\\ndecerno works with entire assignments. working together in tough projects creates a \\nunique company culture. what you don\\'t already know, you can learn from experienced \\ncolleagues.\\nwe build customized business systems and our customer promise is reliable system \\nsolutions. reliability means taking responsibility for the whole. to have an overview and at \\nthe same time control over all details. \\nat decerno, you have great opportunities to constantly further develop your skills. partly \\nthrough the experience of colleagues and partly through our investment in further \\n4education.\\non our conference trips, we discuss lessons learned from our projects. both in terms of \\ntechnology, leadership and business acumen. the trips go to places near and far where we \\ncan spice up the stay with enriching experiences.\\nthe efforts of all employees are crucial for the company\\'s goals and vision to be achieved. \\nthe purpose of the company\\'s personnel policy is to develop knowledgeable, motivated and \\ncommitted employees.\\ndecerno encourages initiatives from employees that contribute to the development of the \\ncompany. continuous competence development is a prerequisite for the company\\'s goals \\nand visions to be achieved.\\nthe company stands and falls with committed employees who make an effort to live up to \\nour shared value base and work with decerno\\'s customer promise \"reliable system \\nsolutions\" as a goal.\\n5⦁ the personnel handbook\\nthis personnel handbook applies to all companies within decerno, i.e. both for decerno ab \\nand decerno väst ab.\\nthe personnel handbook is your reference book for all personnel-related questions. if you \\ndo not find the answer to your question, ask it to your nearest manager. the majority of our \\nemployees work as consultants. they therefore get the most space in the personnel \\nhandbook. those who work in other roles such as hr, sales etc. are of course just as \\nimportant, but to a somewhat greater degree may need to seek answers from the \\nimmediate manager for questions that are specific to the role.\\nthe latest version is always available on the intranet. the rules and benefits described in the \\nhandbook are the ones currently in force. these may be changed or adjusted in the future. \\nwe strive to always announce major news via the weekly newsletter, but it is the \\nresponsibility of each employee to know the rules and procedures documented in the \\nhandbook.\\nthe personnel handbook is part of decerno\\'s inka management system, which is \\ndocumented in our operations handbook. the entire operating manual is available on the \\nintranet.\\n6⦁ collective agreement\\nwithin decerno there are several legal entities, decerno ab and decerno väst ab.\\ndecerno väst ab follows the almega it companies\\' collective agreement.\\ndecerno ab does not have a collective agreement.\\ncertain employment conditions and benefits are governed by the collective agreement and \\nmay therefore differ. where applicable, this will be described in the personnel handbook. \\nwe strive to have the same conditions for all companies as far as possible.\\n⦁ salary and benefits\\ndecerno offers all employees a large number of benefits and allowances. the salary is one \\nof the biggest but there are also many other benefits.\\n⦁ salary policy\\ndecerno\\'s salary policy is a means of stimulating and rewarding good work efforts. the basis \\nis therefore a results-oriented salary setting. wages must be individual in a way that is fair \\nand based on a factual basis. differences in pay must never be based on gender.\\nthe wage trend is determined by several factors. in addition to personal results, it can be \\ndetermined by factors such as the degree of difficulty of the work and one\\'s own personal \\ndevelopment. we are positive about performance-based bonuses as long as this is \\nperceived as fair and factually based.\\ndecerno\\'s salaries must be market-based. we compare with relevant statistics on the labor \\nmarket, such as sweden\\'s engineers\\' statistics for civil engineers who work with \\ncorresponding tasks.\\nyou can read more about our salary policy and salary criteria in the operations manual. \\n⦁ salary, allowances \\n⦁ salary is paid no later than the 25th of each month\\n⦁ salary is paid for the current month\\n7⦁ \\n vacation, leave, illness, etc. are regulated the following month\\n⦁ documents for expenses/travel are submitted within two weeks\\n⦁ \\n reimbursement for expenses is paid together with salary\\n⦁ salary change\\ndecerno offers its employees a salary exchange for an occupational pension, which can be a \\nway to increase their total pension. however, there are pitfalls that mean that salary \\nswitching is not suitable for everyone. talk to your immediate manager if you are interested \\nin knowing more.\\n⦁ recruitment bonus\\ndecerno wants to offer a generous recruitment bonus to all employees who help us find \\nmore employees. to recommend a person for one of our recruitments, talk to hr.\\nwe pay recruitment bonuses according to the following conditions:\\n⦁ the employee suggests a person who they think would fit in with us who has not \\npreviously been in contact with us.\\n⦁ the sum for the recruitment bonus is :\\nsek 10,000 –for juniors up to 2 years of relevant experience\\nsek 25,000 –for people with more than 2 years of relevant experience\\n⦁ for tips that lead to employment, the bonus is paid when the person starts.\\n⦁ the recruitment bonus applies to all employees who do not have a leading position \\nwithin decerno.\\n⦁ occupational health care \\ndecerno offers all employees occupational health care. the occupational health service \\nworks preventively so that our employees do not suffer from any kind of illness.\\n8occupational health care includes i.a. regular health examinations. health examinations are \\ncarried out every two years.\\nhealth examination is done during working hours and time reported under \"dec admin, \\ninternal administration\" as \"health check acc. plane” .you may register a maximum of 1 \\nhour including travel time for a health examination.\\n⦁ exercise and wellness\\nas an employer, decerno wants to encourage and support our employees to live a healthy \\nlife. that is why we make contributions to exercise and health care.\\nthe principle of compensation is 50/50, i.e. the employee pays half and decerno pays half.\\ndecerno provides grants for exercise and wellness with 50% of expenses up to sek 8,000. \\ndecerno\\'s contribution will therefore be a maximum of sek 4,000 per person. the amount is \\ncalculated per calendar year, i.e. 1 january –31 december.\\n⦁ decerno has agreements with several gyms, i.a. sats, fitness24seven and friskis & \\nsvettis. contact the hr manager or read on the intranet for more information.\\nwe follow the swedish tax agency\\'s instructions for which forms of exercise and health care \\nwe may contribute to.\\nsee further www.skatteverket.se , search for exercise or health care.\\npersonal entry fees and membership fees in sports associations are taxable and therefore \\nnot reimbursed.\\nit is important that the receipt you submit contains the information required for decerno to \\nreceive a deduction for the cost and for you to be able to receive compensation for your \\nexpenses. if you are the least bit unsure about what applies, contact the finance \\ndepartment.\\n⦁ coffee and fruit in the office\\nour coffee breaks together are important occasions for maintaining our social contacts in \\nthe workplace. here you get to meet and discuss with colleagues from other projects or \\ndepartments with whom you might otherwise not have much daily contact.\\nwe have coffee together twice a day. when working remotely, we want to encourage our \\nemployees to book team coffee with each other.\\nfor morning coffee on wednesdays, breakfast is served and in the afternoon on fridays we \\nhave friday coffee, where in addition to coffee and tea, something tasty is served.\\nthe responsibility for fixing the friday coffee, and putting on coffee and tea for the coffee \\nbreaks is shared between everyone who works in the office.\\n9we also get fruit delivered to the offices.\\n⦁ parental benefit\\n⦁ purpose\\ndecerno wants to show that the family is important by making it easier for parents of young \\nchildren, both mothers and fathers, to use the statutory right to be at home with their child. \\nthat is why we provide extra compensation in addition to what you get from the social \\ninsurance agency. parental pay should facilitate the recruitment of employees with high \\ncompetence. parental pay must also promote gender equality and not least motivate \\nfathers to take parental leave. the parental salary means that the loss of income during \\nparental leave will be somewhat smaller.\\npension is also paid for up to 13 months during parental leave.\\nwe follow the regulations in the almega it companies\\' collective agreement as described \\nbelow.\\n⦁ placement of leave\\nthe employee must, in good time, about 3 months before the start of the leave, together \\nwith his manager plan and agree on the location of the leave. if possible, the leave must be \\narranged so that operations are not significantly disrupted.\\n⦁ compensation for parental leave\\nduring the time that the employee is on parental leave, compensation is paid as follows, \\nprovided that the employee has had uninterrupted employment with the employer for at \\nleast one year before the first day of parental leave.\\nfor a continuous thirty-day period of parental leave with full parental allowance, a monthly \\nsalary minus 30 sick deductions calculated per day is paid as below. the deduction is based \\non 10 price base amounts. compensation is paid for two such thirty-day periods. for those \\nwho have three years of uninterrupted employment with the employer before the first day \\nof parental leave, compensation is issued for six thirty-day periods.\\nnumber of thirty-day periods of parental pay according to the table below:\\nemployment period at the company 1 year 3 years\\nnumber of thirty-day periods of parental pay 2 6\\nthe parental salary the employer must pay is calculated by making deductions from the \\nsalary as below. base amount means price base amount.\\ndeduction/day:\\n10monthly salary of no more than 10 x the base \\namount/1290% x monthly salary x 12 365\\nmonthly salary above 10 x the base amount/12 90% x monthly salary x 12 + \\n365\\n10% x (monthly salary x 12 –10 x base amount)\\n365\\ncompensation is not issued for salary parts above 15 price base amounts.\\nin the case of three-quarters, half, one-quarter or one-eighth parental allowance, three-\\nquarters, half, one-quarter and one-eighth of the amount are paid as above.\\ndecerno offers an extended parental benefit and extends the period for those who choose \\nto take part-time parental leave. however, the compensation cannot exceed the amount \\nthat would have been paid in the event of 100% parental leave.\\ncompensation is paid for a thirty-day period that falls within 24 months from the child\\'s \\nbirth or when custody is obtained in connection with adoption. if parental allowance has \\nbeen reduced/withdrawn according to the general insurance act, compensation according \\nto above must be reduced to the corresponding extent.\\n⦁ \\n⦁ payment\\nparental benefit is paid in connection with other salary payments, i.e. on the 25th of the \\nmonth following withdrawal of the parental benefit.\\nthe time when parental benefit is taken must be time reported under \"absence\" as \"dec \\nparental benefit\". also enter the name of the child for whom you are on parental leave.\\n⦁ monitor glasses\\nwhen your private glasses are not enough in front of the screen, we as your employer stand \\nfor a pair of complete glasses with your strength adapted to screen work, including an eye \\nexamination at an optician. purchase of glasses and frames takes place at synoptik or \\nsmarteyes, with whom we have an agreement. the cost is thus invoiced directly to decerno.\\nthe glass types included are single-ground glasses, near-progressive glasses and room-\\nprogressive glasses. the optician makes the assessment during the eye examination which \\nglasses suit your visual impairment and work best.\\nbefore your visit to the optician, you and the nearest manager need to fill in and sign a \\nrequisition as you for the examination. contact hr for requisition.\\n⦁ blood donation during working hours\\nat decerno, you have the opportunity to donate blood during working hours. there is often \\na shortage of blood and we therefore want to encourage and make it easier to give blood. \\n11the time is registered as \"internal admin\" as \"blood donation\" and with a maximum of one \\nhour including travel time.\\n⦁ mobile phone policy\\na mobile phone is an important and necessary work tool and therefore decerno offers the \\nfollowing solution:\\ntwo price models when purchasing any mobile phone.\\noption 1 - if you choose to keep your phone for 2 years, the cost can amount to sek 8,000 \\nincl. vat.\\noption 2 - if you choose to keep your phone for 3 years, the cost will be sek 12,000 incl. \\nvat.\\nnotify your immediate manager before purchasing the phone if you wish to use option 1 or \\n2.\\nyou can also choose to buy a more expensive phone and pay the difference yourself. when \\nthe purchase amount exceeds the maximum limit, the difference is deducted incl. vat of as \\nnet salary deduction on future salary.\\nthe difference accrues to decerno and is not refunded when a new phone is purchased or \\nemployment is terminated.\\nwe have a subscription with telia at a fixed price which includes free calls, sms and mms \\nwithin sweden. mobile surfing with 15 gb per month is also included.\\nall costs in addition to what is included in the fixed-price subscription are paid by the \\nemployee unless it can be shown that it is work-related.\\nloss/theft of a mobile phone must be reported immediately to the nearest manager, who \\nthen informs it to empty the phone of information.\\nif the phone breaks, decerno pays for the repair. if it cannot be repaired or is not worth \\nrepairing, the phone will be replaced with an equivalent product.\\nwhen purchasing a phone, this is reported to the office assistant who registers the phone in \\nour register.\\nexchanged phones are discarded.\\n⦁ 4.1 headphones\\n12decerno offers all its employees the purchase of headphones for a value of up to sek 1,500 \\nincl. vat.\\npurchases can be made every two years and must be approved in advance by the nearest \\nmanager.\\npurchases are made by the employee himself and reported as expenses in skovik.\\nif the purchase amount exceeds the maximum limit, only the maximum amount of sek \\n1,500 incl. vat in skovik. otherwise, the expenditure report is returned.\\nreplaced headphones are discarded.\\n⦁ competence development and personal \\ndevelopment\\n⦁ skills development policy\\ncompetence development is important both for personal development and for the \\ncompany\\'s development. we therefore invest heavily in this area. at the same time, it is \\nimportant to emphasize that each employee is responsible for their own skills development.\\nwe count all time spent on projects within the field of education as competence \\ndevelopment. examples of training are pure courses and participation in conferences, both \\nof which are booked with the approval of the immediate manager. other education is self-\\neducation obtained by reading manuals/books/course literature or the like. conferences \\norganized by decerno themselves also count as training.\\n⦁ goal setting\\n⦁ 80 hours per person per year and full-time employee are set aside for training\\n⦁ own responsibility to further education\\n⦁ immediate supervisor approves the training\\ndecerno\\'s goal for each employee is that approximately 80 hours per year of paid working \\ntime should be set aside for training/further development. it corresponds to about 5% of an \\nindividual\\'s available productive time and is a reasonable goal for every organization. in \\naddition, it is our hope that everyone further improves themselves by keeping abreast of \\nwhat is happening by reading trade press and interesting literature alongside their work. it is \\nprimarily the employee\\'s own responsibility and interest to further their education. the \\nmain training takes place via the projects. the immediate manager must ensure that the \\ntraining that the company pays for is in the interest of both parties. for junior consultants, \\n13the manager has a special responsibility to both recommend and ensure that training takes \\nplace and that it follows a common thread in the consultant\\'s development.\\nthree days per year are reserved for the overall training/further development that decerno \\ncarries out at its internal conferences and the networking around entrepreneurship, the \\ncompany\\'s development and projects that are carried out at these conferences. overall, we \\nalso tend to set aside additional time for these spring and autumn conferences.\\na benchmark for the training/further development that decerno believes you should \\nundergo is that about four days of the time should be used for training/development aimed \\nat something you may not currently have the budget for. knowledge that can be fun, \\nstimulating or forward-looking in the work role.\\nother training time should be allocated to concrete training within the area of responsibility \\nand work that you are doing right now. such training is the one that gets the most positive \\nand concrete results according to our experience.\\n⦁ dec academy\\ndec academy is our internal forum for skills development. the purpose of dec academy is \\nto create a meeting place for discussion and knowledge exchange on technical and other \\nwork-related issues that are important to the individual and decerno. by important, we \\nmean important in three ways:\\n⦁ technology -we must have access to the methods and tools needed to create \\nreliable system solutions.\\n⦁ competence -we must maintain and develop the staff\\'s competence so that they \\nget personal development and master the tools and methods they need.\\n⦁ market -we have to make sure that we have exactly the skills that the market \\ndemands in the next few years.\\ndec academy organizes a skills seminar where all consultants can participate. the seminars \\ncan be entirely internal or with an external presenter.\\nall employees are encouraged to come up with their own ideas about what topics they want \\nto touch on.\\nthe activities take place during paid working hours, but usually outside the normal working \\nday. time for decacademy is time reported under \"dec/decv/ competence, personal \\ncompetence development\" as \"decacademy\".\\n⦁ employee interview\\nthe purpose of the employee interview is to have a personal dialogue about health and \\nwell-being, to talk about your work situation, to clarify expectations, to follow up \\nperformance against set goals, to stimulate and develop your skills, to create a good \\nworking climate, to set individual goals in in accordance with the company\\'s goals, to \\ndetermine a personal development plan and to provide a basis for planning and developing \\n14decerno\\'s processes.\\nemployee interviews take place once a year according to a special template and are later \\nsupplemented with a follow-up interview and a salary interview.\\nthe employee interview is a two-way conversation and your feedback to your manager is \\njust as important as the manager\\'s feedback to you.\\nduring the conversation, personal goals must be set and a competence development plan \\ndetermined.\\n⦁ mentor\\nas part of your skills development, there is an opportunity to get a mentor. decerno\\'s \\nmentorship program is intended to last for one year with the goal that it should lead to \\npersonal and professional development, both for mentee and mentor. by taking the help of \\na mentor who has important experience, skills and networks as an apprentice, you get the \\nopportunity to develop and become better at handling a situation, your profession or an \\nenvironment.\\na mentor is a support and a sounding board in your professional role. the mentor\\'s task is \\nto contribute to your development in various ways and to support and challenge you based \\non your goals.\\nit may be appropriate to have a mentor if you:\\n⦁ is employed as a recent graduate\\n⦁ if you want to influence your own development and are prepared to take on new \\ntasks\\n⦁ if you take on your first assignment in a new role, for example as a project manager \\nor system architect\\n⦁ in connection with rehabilitation\\nas a mentor, you get the opportunity to share the knowledge you have built up during your \\nworking life and practice guiding and inspiring your less experienced colleagues, thus \\ndeveloping leadership skills.\\nread more about our mentoring program on the intranet and talk to your immediate \\nmanager if you think it would be relevant for you to have a mentor.\\n⦁ conferences\\nour conferences are very important both for competence development and for building our \\ncompany culture. we usually arrange two conferences per year.\\n15⦁ summer conference\\nthe summer conference is normally a shorter conference with a full day and possibly an \\novernight stay. the program is a combination of skills development, information, team-\\nbuilding and social activities.\\n⦁ autumn conference\\nthe autumn conference is one of the biggest investments we make. every year, the entire \\nstaff gathers for a few intensive days to learn from each other and experience things \\ntogether. the conference is very important both for competence development and \\ncompany culture.\\nthe autumn conference is usually carried out in the form of a trip. we have a tradition of \\nspicing up an intensive conference program with shared experiences and visits. over the \\nyears, we have visited most corners of the world, from japan to svalbard and mexico.\\nour autumn conference is traditionally a slightly longer conference. it usually extends over \\ntwo to three working days and a weekend. the length and destination of the conference \\nvaries and depends, among other things, on how the company is doing.\\nthe autumn conference is organized by a travel group consisting of employees at decerno.\\nin order to enable the lavish trips we make, it is required that the employee spends a \\ncertain amount of his own time. the time of the conference that takes place on working \\ndays is counted as working time and 8 hours per working day is reported on \" dec/decv \\ncompetence, personal competence development\" as \"conference internal\". there is also a \\nspecial activity for preparation. other time during the trip is the responsibility of the \\nemployee.\\n⦁ time accounting course and external conference\\n⦁ when participating in external courses and conferences, a maximum of 8 hours \\nper day are reported incl. travel time. time on holidays is not reported.\\n⦁ course/conference is time reported under \"dec/decv competence, personal \\ncompetence development\" as \"external conference\" or \"course/seminar\" .\\n⦁ introduction of new employees\\n⦁ introduction\\nit is very important that as a new employee you get a good introduction and a good first \\n16impression of the company.\\na couple of times a year, induction days are held where everyone who has been employed \\nin the past six months is invited.\\nin addition to the induction day, it is very important that the new employee gets to meet \\nthe people who are important to getting started with the work. the best way to get in and \\nget to know the business is always to work on a project. a plan for the new employee\\'s first \\nperiod is drawn up together with the immediate manager.\\nfollow-up of the introduction takes place through conversations with the immediate \\nmanager or hr after 3 and 6 months respectively. after that, regular routines with \\ndevelopment interviews take place.\\n⦁ sponsor \\nour goal is that everyone who starts with us at decerno should get the best possible \\nintroduction and a good first impression of us as a workplace. it is therefore important that \\nwe all think about doing what we can to make it easier for our new employees, both in \\ngetting into work and into the community. regardless of whether it\\'s about inviting you to \\ncoffee/lunch or answering questions about work. it can also be good to have another \\nperson to turn to, in addition to your immediate manager, if questions etc. arise. all new \\nemployees are therefore given a sponsor who has special responsibility for being supportive \\nduring the first 3 months.\\nare you going to sponsor a new employee? clearer guidelines are available from \\nhr/immediate manager.\\n⦁ working hours and time reporting\\n⦁ guidelines for working hours\\nnormal working hours are 40 hours per week. we have flexible working hours and you can \\ncontrol when you work on the condition that it works with your project. agree your wishes \\nwith your project manager.\\n⦁ time accounting and time bank\\nour system for recording time worked is called maya. in maya, all time worked and any \\nabsences are recorded.\\neach week is marked clear by the employee and then certified by the immediate manager, \\nor in some cases by your project manager. at the end of the month, you must mark invoice \\nready. in order for our invoicing to be done according to plan, this must be done no later \\n17than 8 am on the 1st working day of the month.\\ndays off are, except for red holidays\\n⦁ midsummer eve\\n⦁ christmas eve\\n⦁ new year\\'s eve\\n⦁ in years in which the national day falls on a saturday or sunday, the employee \\ngets an extra 8 hours in his time bank to be able to be off on another day.\\n⦁ the employee plans his own time in consultation with the project \\nmanager/manager.\\nany time in addition to regular working hours is saved in a time bank in maya.\\ntime in the time bank is either taken out as leave hour by hour or in money.\\nit is allowed to have a minus in the time bank, but a maximum of 40 hours.\\nyou can interrupt work for private matters during a working day, for example banking \\nmatters, visiting social media, etc. these tasks may be carried out provided they are not \\nreported as working time.\\nyou can get hours from the time bank paid out in money. each hour is worth approx. \\nmonthly salary/166. notify the finance department in such a case. if the time bank exceeds \\n200 hours, the excess hours above 150 hours are automatically paid. this payment is made \\nthe month after each quarter.\\n⦁ personnel planning\\nin order for our project managers to know how much resources they have available and for \\nus to be able to plan and forecast our operations, all consultants must plan their time. the \\nplanning is done together with your project manager and entered into maya. the planning \\nmust be updated at least before each change of month.\\n⦁ policy for remote work\\nwe believe in a flexible way of working. a flexible way of working gives greater freedom and \\ncan contribute to a better balance between work and leisure. we therefore offer our \\nemployees the opportunity to work remotely, provided that the current tasks are suitable \\nand that the circumstances allow it. many tasks are well suited to be carried out remotely. \\nat the same time, as an employer, we want to create a good working environment with a \\nstrong corporate culture, community and team spirit that is strengthened by meeting \\nphysically. we are therefore keen on a balance between remote and on-site work.\\n18⦁ extent\\nthe possibility of remote work and the extent to which it is suitable are decided in \\nconsultation between employees, project managers and the immediate manager where \\nmutual trust forms the basis. the possibility of remote work may change over time \\ndepending on, for example, current tasks, personal circumstances and the needs of the \\nbusiness. the employer can always request attendance at the workplace. this policy covers \\nremote work within sweden. we are generally positive about remote work outside of \\nsweden as well, but the labor law regulations make this difficult. as tax regulations, validity \\nof insurance etc. differ from country to country, this must always be agreed together with \\nour hr department. the employee is responsible for finding out which rules apply in the \\ncountry in question.\\nworking hours and availability\\nwhen working remotely, the employee must be available in the same way as when working \\nin the office during regular working hours. it is important to maintain close contact with \\none\\'s colleagues. digital work tools must be kept up-to-date with status and/or other \\ninformation in order to be able to carry out the daily work in a well-functioning way, both \\nfor oneself and vis-à-vis colleagues.\\n⦁ working environment\\na prerequisite for remote work is that the employee has a work space designed in a suitable \\nway. the employee must ensure that the workplace is designed and furnished in an \\nappropriate manner from a work environment point of view.\\nwhen working remotely, the manager and the employee must work together to create a \\nsustainable work environment. the employee accepts that the employer, after contacting \\nthe employee, may visit him at the remote workplace or can ensure his work environment \\nresponsibility in another suitable way.\\nsee also 1150 work environment policy.\\n⦁ equipment\\nwhen working remotely, the employee can, after an individual assessment of needs, borrow \\ncertain equipment and work tools by agreement between the employee and manager. the \\nemployee is responsible for a stable internet connection.\\nthere will always be access to space and equipment at our offices, but in the case of \\nextensive remote work, access to your own place may be limited.\\n⦁ secrecy\\nthe employee has a duty of loyalty to the employer even when working remotely and must \\nobserve confidentiality with the data he handles in remote work according to the same rules \\nas at the workplace.\\n⦁ miscellaneous\\n19the employee is not entitled to travel time compensation or allowances to an extent other \\nthan according to the company\\'s policy and in no case for travel between the remote and \\nmain workplace.\\n⦁ decerno meetings & social activities\\ndecerno organizes decerno meetings of two types: mandatory and social. the mandatory \\nones are of an informative nature, while social meetings are about having fun with your \\ncolleagues. the meetings are partly a forum for conveying information and partly a way to \\nget to know your colleagues better and create a stronger company culture.\\n⦁ mandatory decerno meetings\\nthe mandatory informative meetings held are company information, regional meetings and \\ngroup meetings. see more detailed information about the respective meeting format and \\ntime reporting below:\\ndedcernoinfo -once a month, the ceo holds company information online for all employees. \\ncompany-wide information, financial outcome and more are presented here.\\nregional meetings - every 4-8 weeks, regional meetings are held in gothenburg and \\nstockholm. the content of these meetings can be information about what is happening in \\nour projects, results for the units and more. most often, food is offered at the meetings, \\nwhich are either held in the office or in an external location.\\ngroup meetings - every 4-8 weeks, the respective consultant manager holds group \\nmeetings with his employees. an important goal of these meetings is to create more \\nopportunities for dialogue between managers and employees in a smaller group where it is \\neasier for everyone to speak.\\nif necessary, local office meetings are also held.\\nparticipation in these meetings is mandatory and the time is timed under \"dec/decv admin, \\ninternal administration\" as \"company meeting\".\\ntime for preparation for these types of meetings is time reported under \"dec/decv admin, \\ninternal administration\" as \"preparation ftg meeting/activity\".\\n⦁ regional social activities\\nvarious social activities are continuously organized during the year. it is important to us that \\nwe have fun together even outside the projects! examples of activities could be an aw, \\ncooking together, a visit to the theater or a go-cart, the possibilities are endless! the social \\nactivities are of course voluntary and do not count as working time. it is important that the \\n20activity is open for everyone to sign up for, even if there may be restrictions on the number \\nwho can participate in the activity itself (eg the first 20 who sign up get a place). decerno \\ncovers part or all of the cost of the activity. how the social activities are organized differs \\nbetween the east, south and west regions.\\nin region ost and syd, we encourage the employees to take the initiative in social activities \\nthemselves. if you have an idea for something you would like to do together with your \\ncolleagues, do not hesitate to contact ulrika for region east or viktor for region south. they \\nhelp with the planning of the activity and ensure that it fits into the calendar with other \\nplanned events and that we get a good range of activities.\\nin region väst, the responsibility circulates among employees who organize activities \\ntogether 2 and 2 according to a schedule.\\ntime for preparation before a social activity is time reported under \"dec/dec v admin, \\ninternal administration\" as \"preparation ftg meeting/activity\". the activity itself takes place \\noutside working hours and is not time-reported.\\n⦁ other social activities\\nin addition to the activities described above, christmas parties and summer parties are also \\norganized, which may vary slightly from office to office.\\nsocial activities can also be organized per team or project.\\n⦁ absence\\n⦁ planned absence\\nabsence must be planned as far in advance as possible and must be agreed with the project \\nmanager so that we can plan our projects. if you plan to be absent for 3 days or more, you \\nmake an absence request via maya no later than 1 month before the planned absence. \\ndon\\'t forget to also update your personnel planning.\\n⦁ parental leave\\n⦁ application for parental leave\\nin the case of parental leave for a longer period of time, it is important that you apply for \\nleave in good time, at least 3 months before. when the parental leave has been granted, \\nyou notify the finance department so that payroll processing and pension provisions are \\ncorrect. to use our parental benefit, you need to apply in maya with dec parental benefit \\nfor the months to which you are entitled.\\nin addition to parental leave, you also have the right to reduce working hours until your \\n21child turns eight.\\nin case of parental leave for more than 3 months at 10% or more, the duty rate in maya is \\nchanged to the working time approved via the absence application. the pension premium is \\ncalculated based on the new salary. \\nif you were to work occasional hours during your parental leave, you report the time for \\nthese hours and they become plus hours in your time bank.\\n⦁ health insurance\\nduring the time that you do not receive any compensation from decerno during your \\nparental leave, benefit taxation is saved on your first salary when you are back at work.\\n⦁ vacation\\nwithin decerno, we apply two different schemes for holidays. this is because the history \\nhas looked different in the companies that are today part of decerno. contact the payroll \\ndepartment if you are unsure of what applies to you.\\n⦁ holiday year 1 april – 31 march\\nour standard model is based on the holiday law and refers to the holiday year from 1 april \\nto 31 march with the earning year followed by the withdrawal year.\\nthis means that during your first year of employment, you work in vacation days that can \\nthen be taken during the upcoming vacation year.\\n⦁ holiday year 1 january – 31 december   \\nfor historical reasons, some employees have the holiday year from 1 january to 31 \\ndecember. since the accrual year and withdrawal year coincide, vacation days are worked in \\nin the same year that they are available to be used.\\nupon termination of employment, a settlement is made against accrued vacation days and \\nany debt will be offset against your final salary.\\n⦁ advance vacation\\nwe offer advance vacation, which means that you can have the opportunity to be off \\nalready during your first year of employment in the form of vacation without salary \\ndeduction.\\n22if you start your employment before september 1, you have the option to take 30 days in \\nadvance in the first year, and if you start your employment after september 1, you have the \\nright to take 5 vacation days.\\nduring your second year of employment, you get access to the vacation days you earned \\nduring your first year of employment. the vacation days that you have not yet worked are \\nfilled with advance vacation up to your vacation entitlement and taking into account any \\nnon-holiday absences.\\nexample: you are employed on 1 october. until march 31, you can take 5 days of holiday in \\nadvance. on april 1, you get 30 new vacation days. since you only had time to work \\nvacation for 6 months, 15 of these days are paid and the remaining days will be advance \\nvacation.\\nif employment ends within 5 years from your employment date, a settlement is made \\nagainst earned days and any debt is offset against your final salary.\\n⦁ unpaid vacation days\\nin the event of renouncing the use of advance leave, as an employee, in accordance with \\nthe leave act, you have the right to take unpaid leave.\\nif you start your employment before september 1, you have the right to take 25 unpaid \\nvacation days and if you start your employment on september 1 or later, you have the right \\nto take 5 unpaid vacation days.\\n⦁ guidelines for holiday withdrawals\\naccording to the holidays act, every employee has the right to a continuous holiday of at \\nleast four weeks during the period june - august. only in exceptional cases may the holiday \\nbe postponed to another time.\\nin order for us to be able to ensure your employment, we want at least 3 weeks to be taken \\nduring weeks 26 to 32, unless otherwise agreed.\\nthe holiday act also states that you must take at least 20 holiday days during the holiday \\nyear. this applies on condition that the days are earned and paid for. excess holiday days \\ncan be saved for withdrawal in later years, but for a maximum of 5 years.\\nthis year\\'s vacation days must be taken before saved days from previous years.\\nholidays are planned in consultation with the project manager and/or immediate \\nsupervisor. the holiday application must be entered in maya and approved by the \\nimmediate manager. for the summer holidays, the holiday application must be submitted \\nby april 30 at the latest.\\n⦁ holiday pay supplement\\n23for each earned vacation day that is taken, you will receive, in addition to your salary, a \\nvacation pay supplement. contact the payroll department (payroll@decerno.se) if you want \\nmore information about this.\\n⦁ holiday-based absence\\ncertain types of absence are vacation-based. this is regulated by the holiday act. the \\nfollowing reasons for absence from work give the right to holiday leave (the list is not \\ncomprehensive).\\nillness , a maximum of 180 calendar days per earning year. \\nparental allowance , maximum 120 calendar days at each birth. this also applies to multiple \\npregnancies. for a parent with sole custody, the limit is 180 calendar days. in the case of \\npart-time parental leave, 86 working days are counted.\\nmaternity pay , a maximum of 50 days is holiday pay.\\ntemporary parental allowance , maximum 120 days per child per year for children under 12 \\nyears of age.\\nfamily care , a maximum of 45 calendar days per earning year.\\n⦁ doctor\\'s visit\\ndoctor\\'s visits are valid absences and are reported as a separate activity in maya. the time \\nis not compensated by the employer. when you report the absence type \"doctor\\'s visit\" in \\nmaya, salary deductions for the time are made on the next salary.however, see 3.4 on \\noccupational health care.\\n⦁ sick leave\\nmost of the rules regarding sick leave are governed by laws and regulations. in addition, \\ndecerno provides an extended sick pay as described under points 9.5.4 -9.5.7 .\\n⦁ notification of absence in case of illness\\nwhen you get sick, you make an absence report in maya. when you make an absence \\nreport in maya, an email is automatically sent to the nearest manager. you must notify your \\nproject manager and your project colleagues yourself.\\n⦁ carenage deduction\\nwe comply with the sickness pay act and the collective agreement for it companies, where \\nqualifying deductions correspond to 20 percent of a normal working week. absence \\ndeductions may therefore need to be made in more or less than one day, but not by more \\n24than what corresponds to 20 percent of a normal working week, depending on when the \\nemployee becomes ill.\\n⦁ relapse\\nif you fall ill again within five calendar days from the end of the previous sick period, this \\nmeans that the sick pay period continues. if full qualifying period deduction is not made \\nduring the first period of illness, further qualifying period deductions must be made in the \\ncontinuing period of illness.\\nit is not possible to get more than ten waiting periods during a twelve-month period.\\n⦁ medical certificate\\nfrom the eighth calendar day of the sick period, you are obliged to submit a medical \\ncertificate to the employer. leave to the nearest manager or hr who forwards to payroll.\\n⦁ sick pay period days 2 – 14\\nfrom the second to the fourteenth day of sick leave, decerno pays sick pay. the 2-week \\nperiod is calculated on a calendar basis, all days are counted regardless of how the working \\nhours are arranged. if the withdrawal date falls on a wednesday, the 2-week period ends on \\nthe tuesday two weeks later.\\nsick leave and sick pay, on the other hand, are only calculated for the hours you would have \\nworked. as of the second day, sick pay is paid at 80% of the regular salary. the sick \\nallowance is calculated in the same way as during the waiting period and sick pay is also \\npaid, which is calculated per hour.\\n⦁ sick for more than 14 days\\nfrom the 15th sick day onwards, försäkringskassan pays sickness benefit and you therefore \\nneed to apply for sickness benefit with försäkringskassan. in addition, decerno pays part of \\nyour regular salary as below. the sick pay deduction that must now be made has a different \\nconstruction. the reason is that there is a certain coordination with the sickness allowance \\nthat försäkringskassan pays.\\n⦁ salary up to 8 basic amounts\\nthe sickness allowance is calculated per calendar day, i.e. you get an amount for each day, \\nincluding saturdays, sundays and other non-working days. a deduction per day is made \\nfrom the 15th sick day: 90% * (monthly salary * 12/365). in other words, we pay out 10% of \\nyour salary in addition to the sickness allowance from försäkringskassan. the right to sick \\npay is valid for 90 days. the sickness allowance is then calculated per day: monthly salary * \\n12/365. since we have different numbers of days in the months of the year, this method of \\ncalculation results in an employee who has been away for the entire month in certain \\nmonths receiving a small portion of the monthly salary and sometimes the salary is not \\nenough for the deduction. to avoid this, the sickness deduction is adjusted so that \\n25deductions are made with the entire monthly salary.\\n⦁ salary above 8 basic amounts\\ndecerno supplements the sick pay försäkringskassan stands further in case your salary \\nexceeds 8 basic amounts.\\nthe sickness allowance that försäkringskassan pays is calculated on an annual income up to \\n8 basic amounts. decerno provides additional compensation so that those with a salary that \\nexceeds 8 base amounts do not lose more in the event of sick leave than those with a lower \\nincome. the rule applies to sick leave of more than 14 days and means that sick pay from \\nthe employer must be paid with an additional 80 % (in addition to the 10% that the 90% \\ndeduction above implies) of the salary that exceeds 8 basic amounts:\\nsick pay: 90% * (monthly salary * 12/365)\\nsick pay: 80% * (monthly salary exceeding 8 bb * 12/365)\\n⦁ sick for more than 90 days\\nin addition to the basic cover from försäkringskassan, all permanent employees have \\nsupplementary health insurance.\\nread more about this under point 14.6\\n⦁ leave \\nleave is a short leave with pay that you get in certain special cases:\\n⦁ own 50th birthday (½ day)\\n⦁ death of a close relative (1 day)\\n⦁ funeral or burial of a close relative (1 day)\\n⦁ sudden severe illness in a close relative living at home (1 day)\\nclose relatives include spouses, cohabitants, children, siblings, parents, in-laws and \\ngrandparents.\\nthe application for leave must be made as early as possible.\\nleave is time reported in maya under \"absence\" as \"permission\" . enter what it refers to in \\nthe notes field.\\n⦁ expenditure and representation\\n26⦁ outlay\\n⦁ generally\\nwhen you pay for expenses that decerno must pay, you must report this as an expense. the \\nexpenses are reported in our system for expense reporting, currently skovik. see link on the \\nintranet.\\nexpenses that are reported and certified by the 10th at the latest are paid out the same \\nmonth.\\nspecial rules apply to expenses for representation. see \\nhttps://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/edition/2023.8/331518.html\\n⦁ what happens if the receipt is left late or is incomplete?\\nit is a very good idea to submit your receipts on time and with the required information. if \\nthe receipt does not contain the necessary information stated above or if it is submitted too \\nlate, there is a risk that you will not be able to withdraw the full amount or that you will be \\ntaxed as a benefit by the tax agency.\\nthe absolute latest time for reporting expenses is:\\njanuary –march: no later than april 10\\napril –june: no later than july 10\\njuly –september: no later than 10 october\\noctober –december: no later than january 10 of the following year\\n⦁ external representation\\nrepresentation means that you offer a customer or other external party food and drink.\\nin order to receive a deduction for representation costs, it is required that there is an \\nimmediate connection between the representation and the business being conducted. in \\nthis way, it is marked that costs for social life of a personal nature and costs for luxury-\\noriented representation are not deductible. the immediate connection is fulfilled when it \\ncomes to establishing and maintaining business relationships. the connection includes both \\na time connection, a person connection and a location connection.\\n⦁ the requirement for time connection states that the representation must be \\nincluded as a natural step and in direct connection with a business negotiation.\\n⦁ the requirement of personal connection is fulfilled only if the persons participating \\nin the representation have a direct connection to the business negotiation. a good \\n27idea is that the number of participants from decerno does not exceed the number \\nfrom the customer.\\n⦁ the requirement for a local connection is met if the representation is exercised in a \\nplace where one of the negotiating parties conducts its business.\\nthe connection between the persons who have participated in the representation and the \\ntaxpayer\\'s business can be confirmed by the documentation containing the following \\ninformation:\\n⦁ date of representation.\\n⦁ name\\n⦁ title, occupation, function in the company regarding all persons against whom \\nrepresentation was exercised.\\n⦁ companies that the persons concerned represent.\\n⦁ the connection between the representation and the taxpayer\\'s business.\\nthe notes are preferably kept on the restaurant bills or similar that form the basis for the \\nrepresentation costs.\\nexpenses for representation together with the necessary information linked to this are \\nreported in decerno\\'s expenses system.\\n⦁ representation with public activities\\nas several of decerno\\'s customers are public enterprises, an adapted regulatory framework \\nfor representation applies to them.\\nin the event that it comes to decerno\\'s knowledge that there are wordings in the \\ncustomer\\'s own policy for representation that further regulate what applies below, the \\ndirectives in the customer\\'s policy are applied. decerno\\'s customer manager must be in the \\nhabit of asking the customer what applies to them at the beginning of a project.\\n⦁ gifts and presents\\ndecerno never gives gifts or presents to our public customers. exceptions to this are modest \\nmemorial gifts such as a simple flower arrangement for an anniversary, open house or the \\nlike.\\n⦁ work in reference group/meet with user group\\nin connection with meetings with reference groups and user groups for decerno\\'s projects, \\nit is our assessment that the main purpose of the meeting is to exchange information in the \\nform of a working meeting, which means that decerno can offer a simpler lunch with an \\naccompanying non-alcoholic drink. this principle also applies to local customer \\narrangements as these are also a forum for mutual information exchange.\\n⦁ arranged customer meetings and training\\ncustomer meetings, training courses or seminars that decerno arranges and where the \\n28customer pays a fee that covers overheads for food, drinks and any entertainment, shall not \\nbe seen as representation in these parts. in cases where alcohol is served, there must \\nalways be an alcohol-free alternative.\\n⦁ fairs and other events\\nin connection with arrangements and events that are not arranged by decerno but where \\ndecerno participates and several of the other participants are customers from the public \\nsector, decerno adapts to the policy that applies to the respective arrangement, therefore it \\nis up to each participant to make sure that you follow your own internal policy for \\nrepresentation. the same applies to events that are open to everyone. examples of this \\ntype of arrangement and event are fairs and \"open house\".\\n⦁ internal representation\\nwe shall generally be restrained with internal representation. compensation for internal \\nrepresentation is allowed at information meetings, project events, major company events \\nand internal training. the immediate manager invites new employees to lunch on the first \\nday of work. representation at group meetings or the like must be approved in advance by \\nthe unit manager. decerno does not normally replace other lunch meetings or other \\nrepresentation within the company or within the addnode group.\\nthe tax exemption for subsistence allowance applies on the condition that the gatherings \\ncan be assessed as internal representation. in order for such an assessment to be made, the \\ngatherings need to be documented. the documentation must state the purpose, content \\nand participants.\\n⦁ purchase of computer\\nwhen changing computers (normally every three years), the employee can buy out the \\nprevious equipment. the price is based on market value and is paid through a net salary \\ndeduction. if you want to buy out your old equipment, notify the nearest manager no later \\nthan one month after you receive your new equipment. your manager for the dialogue with \\nfinance and it regarding pricing and returns with a cost proposal. if you do not want to buy \\nthe equipment, it must be returned to it no later than one month after the exchange.\\n⦁ travel in the service\\n⦁ decerno pays compensation for travel in the service by reimbursing expenses or \\nproviding mileage compensation or the equivalent. the expenses are reported in \\nour system for expense reporting, currently skovik. see link on the intranet. \\ncompensation is paid at the same time as the salary according to 10.1 \\nexpenditure . \\n⦁ travel between the residence and decerno and vice versa is not reimbursed.\\n29⦁ travel policy\\nwhen booking a trip, environmental aspects must always be considered. for example, trains \\nshould be chosen before flights and public transport before cars and taxis.\\nwhen booking travel for a larger group, a risk analysis must always be carried out to identify \\na possible need to split the group.\\n⦁ reservation\\n⦁ each employee is responsible for booking their own business trip.\\n⦁ train\\n⦁ when traveling by train, 2nd class must be selected on x2000 and 1st class on \\nother trains. train bookings must be made via sj prio. for more information, \\ncontact the office assistant in kista or gothenburg to be registered with sj and be \\nable to book your trip yourself against an invoice.\\n⦁ flight\\n⦁ for air travel, an economy class ticket must be selected. when booking a flight, \\nyou must choose to compensate for the climate when the option is available.\\n⦁ hotel\\n⦁ hotel policy: standard equivalent to a 3-4 star hotel, if possible a double room will \\nbe booked. current agreements with hotels can be found on the intranet under \\nmy employment -travel in the service.\\n⦁ taxi\\ndecerno reimburses taxi journeys if the journeys are necessary for work. when you submit \\na travel invoice, you write where the journey started and where it ended and the reason \\nwhy you took a taxi.\\n⦁ \\n⦁ \\n⦁ travel with your own car\\nmileage allowance for business travel is allowed with actual mileage, however, maximized \\n30to the distance calculated from decerno.\\nwhen you make business

reimbursed at actual cost. this applies to trips \\nto the customer or between decerno\\'s offices and thus not between the residence and \\ndecerno\\'s office.\\n⦁ reimbursement for travel expenses for long-term work \\nwith a customer\\nif you have your workplace with a customer for at least one month, you may be entitled to \\ncompensation for a monthly pass/annual pass for local traffic and/or sj. when using \\nmonthly passes/annual passes on local transport and sj, these may only be used for work-\\nrelated travel. separate agreement must be signed. contact your immediate manager if \\napplicable.\\n⦁ allowance\\n⦁ sweden\\nallowance is paid for business travel outside the usual place of business when an overnight \\nstay has taken place. the usual place of business is within 50 km of the place of \\nemployment/home. we follow the swedish tax agency\\'s instructions.\\nallowances are reported in our system for expense accounting, currently skovik. see link on \\nthe intranet. current amounts are shown in the system.\\nthere is no allowance on decerno\\'s conference trips.\\nmeals during business trips -allowances paid for so-called one-day stays (without overnight \\nstays) are treated as normal wages in terms of taxes and fees.\\n⦁ abroad\\ndecerno follows the swedish tax agency\\'s recommendations regarding standard amounts \\nfor each country.\\n31for business trips abroad, the allowance is reduced by:\\n⦁ 85% for completely free food\\n⦁ 70% for lunch and dinner\\n⦁ 35% for lunch or dinner\\n⦁ 15 % for breakfast\\nthere is no allowance on decerno\\'s conference trips.\\n⦁ vacation in connection with a business trip\\nif you take vacation in connection with a business trip, the following applies:\\na 1-day business trip can be combined with a maximum of 1 day of vacation\\na 1-week business trip can be combined with a maximum of 1 week of vacation.\\nif you take vacation in connection with a business trip, the business trip ends when the \\nvacation begins, i.e. no allowance is paid and the time for the journey home must be borne \\nby yourself. such leave must be placed before or after, not in the middle.\\n⦁ travel time\\nthe rules for travel time compensation differ depending on what you have agreed in your \\nemployment contract. if there is nothing about travel time compensation in your \\nemployment contract, you are entitled to travel time compensation. it is common for \\nemployees who have 25 days of vacation to be entitled to travel time compensation, while \\nemployees who have 30 days of vacation are not entitled to travel time compensation \\nbecause the extra vacation days compensate for travel time.\\nif work is carried out while travelling, for example on a train, the time is counted as working \\ntime, not travel time.\\ntravel must, as far as possible, take place outside regular working hours.\\nthe following applies to employees who are entitled to travel time compensation:\\ntravel time is compensated as working time. travel time in addition to regular working \\nhours is saved in the maya time bank.\\ncertain journeys are not counted as travel time and

a customer or office other than the \\nplace of employment can receive compensation for travel time in certain cases. this \\nis an individual agreement with the immediate manager.\\n⦁ employees who work in a project that requires regular travel to another city can \\nreceive compensation for travel time in certain cases. this is an individual \\nagreement with the immediate manager.\\ntravel time reporting in maya:\\ntravel time between customers or to/from project and regular workplace is charged to the \\ncustomer if possible and the time is reported on the project.\\ntravel time that

depending on whether you are employed \\nin a company that has a collective agreement or not. see what applies to you under the \\npoints below:\\n⦁ decerno ab\\nan occupational pension is taken out between the ages of 25 and 65 with avanza pension. \\ndecerno\\'s pension plan means that occupational pension premiums are calculated \\naccording to the table below. \\nthe annual premium is calculated on your annual salary, i.e. the monthly salary x 12 and \\ncurrent income base amount. \\nthe example is based on income base amounts for 2016.\\n38monthly premium at different monthly salaries:\\nmonthly \\nsalarygross \\nsalary \\n0-7.5 \\nibb<=4 \\n44,750 \\n4.5%gross \\nsalary \\n>7.5 \\nibb>4 44 \\n750 \\n30%premiu\\nm/ \\nmonth\\n25,000 13,500 -1,125\\n35,000 18,900 - 1,575\\n45,000 20,014 28,575 4,049\\nthe various insurance elements are:\\n⦁ repayment protection \\nthe starting point is the individual\\'s private family situation.\\n⦁ retirement pension \\nthe employee chooses how he/she wants to manage the pension savings. the \\nsavings premium is managed via selected funds. the employee himself is \\nresponsible for how big the final pension capital will be on the day of retirement. \\naccording to decerno\\'s pension plan with avanza, the premiums are initially \\ndeposited into avanza\\'s fund without fees, avanza zero if you do not choose to \\nallocate the capital to other funds or individual shares.\\n⦁ premium exemption (mandatory) \\nnew from 2012 is that the fee (previously 2.9% of the premium) is outside the \\npension savings as above. it is included as part of the insurance savings, provided \\nthat the employee\\'s state of health is satisfactory. it means that the insurer steps \\nin and pays the occupational pension premium in the event that the employee \\nfalls ill for a long time (longer than 3 months = waiting period). this insurance is \\nmandatory and may not be waived by the employee. this is important because \\ndecerno\\'s obligation to pay the occupational pension premium in case of long-\\nterm illness ends after 3 months of sick leave.\\n⦁ decerno väst ab\\nas an employee in a company with a collective agreement, you have occupational pension \\nitp, which is an insurance package that includes:\\n⦁ pension -which you can withdraw from the age of 55\\n⦁ your family in case of long-term illness\\n⦁ protection for your family when you die\\nread more about your occupational pension at www.collectum.se\\n39⦁ health insurance \\nwhen you are permanently employed at decerno, you receive healthcare insurance via \\neuroaccident (privataccess silver). the insurance premium is paid by decerno. for all \\nphysical doctor\\'s visits and treatments, a fee of approx. sek 500 is paid at the first visit per \\ninjury/care intervention. decerno pays such a fee to each employee per calendar year. in \\norder for the insurance to be taken out, it is required that you are fully able to work.\\nwith health care insurance, you get a \"fast-track\" to qualified private specialist care. the \\ninsurance makes it possible to book an appointment directly with a specialist doctor. if you \\nshould need an operation, it will also be arranged through the insurance and you will avoid \\nunnecessary waiting times.\\nthe insurance also includes an e-care service completely free for all policyholders. it can be \\nused to consult a doctor over the web and receive advice and prescriptions for \"simpler \\nailments\".\\nfor the insurance to apply, you need to seek care immediately when you get symptoms. if \\nyou previously experienced the same symptoms or sought treatment for your symptoms in \\nthe last 12 months, the insurance does not cover.\\nthe insurance is a taxable benefit and benefits are taxed every month from the month \\nemployment begins until the month employment ends.\\nbuy private insurance\\nyou can also buy private insurance for you and your family via avanza. there are health care \\ninsurances, accident insurances, life insurances, etc. these insurances are completely \\nindependent from decerno and are paid and thus administered privately. if you have
